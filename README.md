# shelly-2to1-mqtt
Extension to Shelly Gen2 devices to enable Gen1 compatible (Shelly)MQTT reporting and control.
Currently this is supported:
- power/energy sensor
- total sensor (if enabled - reports total energy as additional sensor)
- switch status and control

To be implemented:
- inputs

Script is developed and tested on Shelly Pro 4PM devices, but should work on any Gen2 device providing similar sensors/switches.

# install
Simply add script via Gen2 device's web UI, enable it (to auto start on device reboot) and start.
